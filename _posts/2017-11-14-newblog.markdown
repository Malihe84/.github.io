# What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

Robots.txt is a small file in website root directory and it is identifiesd ifferent parts of websit which it should not be available to crawlers. I write (meta name="googlebot" content="noindex") under HEADER to prevent Google's crawlers but no-one from indexing the page.
And in humans.txt file i used a method which the pages are hidden in search results, but the Media Partners-Google crawler can still analyze them to determine which ads will appear to visitors to my site.

{% highlight ruby %}
 User-agent: *
 Disallow: /
 User-agent: Mediapartners-Google
 Allow: /
{% endhighlight %}
