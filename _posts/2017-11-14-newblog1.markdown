# How did you implements comments to blog posts?

{% highlight ruby %}
 I used DisQus which is help the publishe rto make a website that allows to audiences to write their own opinion.
 For using Disqus should we register and make an account in <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">Disqus</a>
 Then you can use the source code which Disqus provided for you.
{% endhighlight %}
I creat a HTML file which is contain the disqus code.
