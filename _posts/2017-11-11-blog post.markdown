# What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?

 Css preprocessors such as Sass takes the written code like the Scss and converts it to normal CSS. By using precompiling process, i do not need to repeated code-writing and that is why i use it beacuase it is just great.

{% highlight ruby %}
 1. Compare to regular CSS
    It is quicker to write syntax of SASS and SCSS.
    We can read and change the code using variables easier with nesting the syntax.

 2. Which techniques did you use?
    I used different techniques such as variables for all colores and fonts.

{% highlight ruby %}
 3. Pros and cons?
    I think it is more pros than cons. 
    By using CSS pre-compiling, i can sparing time 
    ,and i do not need to repeat my self(DRY) beacuase it allows us to reuse code. 
    But it has some disadvantages like ,debugging the code may offer some problem,since generated code line-numbers are not
    ,the same as within the source code.
