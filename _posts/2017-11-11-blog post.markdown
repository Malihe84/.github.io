  # What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?
 Css preprocessors such as Sass takes the written code like the Scss and converts it to normal CSS. By using precompiling process, i do not need to repeated code-writing and that is why i use it beacuase it is just great.

 1. Compare to regular CSS
 It is quicker to write syntax of SASS and SCSS.
 
 2. Which techniques did you use?
 3. Pros and cons?
